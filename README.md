# Telekinesis-Control
 
# Telekinesis gameplay system heavily inspired by a feature in the game by Remedy - "Control"

# Created in the unreal engine with a test area; rocks can be found throughout the scene that can be picked up and brought to the player. These objects will stick with the player as they navigate through the game world, which can then be used as a physics based weapon as it can be thrown towards enemies.
